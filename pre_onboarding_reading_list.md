* **How we do code reviews at Hypothesis**

  * Micheal Lynch's amazing **How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human**: [part one](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/) and
    [part two](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-2/)
  * [Our own blog post about code reviews](https://www.seanh.cc/2016/10/04/code-review/)

  Our approach to code reviews at Hypothesis is one example of how we put some of our engineering values into practice: good communication, lifting the
  team, checking your ego, avoiding attachment, consensus.
  [Reviewing with care and humanity](https://hyp.is/-Q6K2gwfEe2htfvft46lfg/web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/) is specifically called out in our
  engineering values.

  The canonical source for code reviews at Hypothesis is the _Stack Overflow for Teams_ question
  [How do I do a good pull request review?](https://stackoverflow.com/c/hypothesis/questions/303) but the new team member won't have access to that until
  they have a Stack Overflow account that's a member of our team so I've pulled out the articles that it links to above.
