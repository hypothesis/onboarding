Pre-onboarding Reading List
===========================

* The [Hypothesis Mission](https://web.hypothes.is/about/) explains why we do
  what we do.

  A big part of our focus nowaways is one the use of Hypothesis in education.
  [Hypothesis for Education](https://web.hypothes.is/education/) describes why
  we're bringing digital annotation to students.

  Annotation isn't just for education.
  [Journalism & Fact-Checking](https://web.hypothes.is/journalism/),
  [Hypothesis for Publishers](https://web.hypothes.is/publishing/),
  and [Hypothesis for Research](https://web.hypothes.is/research/)
  describe our visions for Hypothesis in other fields.

* The [Hypothesis Company Principles](https://web.hypothes.is/principles/)
  are the high-level principles that guide everything we build at Hypothesis.

* The [Hypothesis Engineering Values](https://web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/)
  describe the engineering culture we aspire to create at Hypothesis, and are a
  reference that all team members should be familiar with.

* **How we do code reviews at Hypothesis**

  Our approach to code reviews at Hypothesis is one example of how we put some
  of our engineering values into practice: good communication, lifting the
  team, checking your ego, avoiding attachment, consensus.
  [Reviewing with care and humanity](https://hyp.is/-Q6K2gwfEe2htfvft46lfg/web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/)
  is specifically called out in our engineering values.

  The canonical source for code reviews at Hypothesis is the _Stack Overflow
  for Teams_ question
  [How do I do a good pull request review?](https://stackoverflow.com/c/hypothesis/questions/303)
  but new team members won't have access to that until they have a Stack
  Overflow account that's a member of our team so I've pulled out the articles
  that the question links to:

  * Micheal Lynch's amazing **How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human**:
    [part one](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/) and
    [part two](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-2/)
  * [Our own blog post about code reviews](https://www.seanh.cc/2016/10/04/code-review/)
