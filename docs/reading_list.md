Pre-onboarding Reading List
===========================

This is a short reading list that we send out to new engineers before their first day at Hypothesis.

## What Hypothesis Is About

  what we do.

## Working at Hypothesis

* Our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hypothesis/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  defines our open source community standards and procedures.

* The [Hypothesis Engineering Values](https://web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/)
  describe the engineering culture we aspire to create at Hypothesis, and are a
  reference that all team members should be familiar with.

  our engineering values into practice.
