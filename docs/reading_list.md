Pre-onboarding Reading List
===========================

This is a short reading list that we send out to new engineers before their first day at Hypothesis.

* The [Hypothesis Mission](https://web.hypothes.is/about/) explains why we do
  what we do.

* [Hypothesis for Education](https://web.hypothes.is/education/) describes why
  we're bringing digital annotation to students and teachers.

* [Journalism & Fact-Checking](https://web.hypothes.is/journalism/),
  [Hypothesis for Publishers](https://web.hypothes.is/publishing/),
  and [Hypothesis for Research](https://web.hypothes.is/research/)
  describe our visions for Hypothesis in other fields.

* The [Hypothesis Company Principles](https://web.hypothes.is/principles/)
  are the high-level principles that guide everything we build at Hypothesis.

* Our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hypothesis/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  defines our open source community standards and procedures.

* The [Hypothesis Engineering Values](https://web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/)
  describe the engineering culture we aspire to create at Hypothesis, and are a
  reference that all team members should be familiar with.

* **Code review** is one of the main ways that developers interact with each other during their work so
  [reviewing with care and humanity](https://hyp.is/-Q6K2gwfEe2htfvft46lfg/web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/) is specifically called out in our
  engineering values. Code reviews should be kind, patient, friendly and helpful, an uplifting experience that helps to foster a team culture that upholds 
  our engineering values. For some reading on code review techniques see:

  * Micheal Lynch's amazing **How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human** ([part one](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/) and
  [part two](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-2/))
