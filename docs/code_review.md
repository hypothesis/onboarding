Code Review at Hypothesis
=========================

All code changes should normally be sent as pull requests and all pull requests
should normally be reviewed and approved before merging.

Code review is one of the main ways that developers interact with each other
during their work. At Hypothesis we want code reviews to be done with care and
humanity. They should be kind, patient, friendly and helpful, an uplifting
experience that helps to foster a team culture that upholds our
engineering values.

Our reference documents for how to do a good pull request review are:

* The [Review with care and humanity](https://hyp.is/-Q6K2gwfEe2htfvft46lfg/web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/)
  section of our engineering values
* Micheal Lynch's amazing **How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human**:
  [part one](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/) and [part two](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-2/)
