In this phase of your onboarding you'll start reviewing pull requests (PRs) from other developers.
Your buddy will help you identify some good first PRs to review.

- [ ] **Buddy**: identify some good first PRs and assign them to the new engineer to review.

- [ ] **Engineer**: re-read our [Engineering Values](https://web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/). 
  They describe the kinds of PRs that we want and how we want you to approach code review.

- [ ] **Engineer**: read our [code review guidelines](https://github.com/hypothesis/onboarding/blob/main/docs/code_review.md).
  These go into more detail about how we do code review.

- [ ] **Engineer**: check out the pull request branch locally and test it.
  The PR should contain testing instructions. If not, you can request them from the PR's author.

- [ ] **Engineer**: check off this item once you've approved your first PR.
  In most cases, it is the author's responsibility to merge and deploy a PR once it has been approved.
