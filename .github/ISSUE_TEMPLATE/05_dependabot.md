We receive regular automated pull requests from Dependabot. Each developer is responsible for reviewing and deploying their fair share of dependency upgrades. In this phase of your onboarding you'll start reviewing Dependabot PRs, merging them, and deploying them to production.

- [ ] **Engineer**: read our [docs about handling Dependabot PRs](https://github.com/hypothesis/onboarding/blob/main/docs/dependabot.md).
- [ ] **Engineer**: review and deploy your first batch of Dependabot PRs.

  You can use the [`dependencies` label on GitHub](https://github.com/pulls?q=org%3Ahypothesis+is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+sort%3Acreated+label%3Adependencies+) to find open Dependabot PRs. Your buddy can help you identify some good ones to tackle first.
