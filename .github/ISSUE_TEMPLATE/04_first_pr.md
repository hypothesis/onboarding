In this phase of your onboarding you'll start making your first pull requests (PRs) to Hypothesis projects, getting your PRs reviewed, and deploying them to production. Your buddy will help you identify some simple issues to tackle for your first PRs.

You can close this issue once you've deployed at least one of your PRs to production.

- [ ] **Buddy**: identify some good first issues and assign them to the new engineer.
  The [**good first issue** label](https://github.com/issues?q=org%3Ahypothesis+is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) might help.

- [ ] **Engineer**: read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hypothesis/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

  All engineers need to read the CoC: it establishes some base expectations for your behavior as a participant in Hypothesis projects.

- [ ] **Engineer**: read our [Engineering Values](https://web.hypothes.is/jobs/engineering-values/).

  All engineers should be familiar with our engineering values: they describe the type of work that we want you to do.

- [ ] **Engineer**: read our [guidelines for how to make a good PR][1].

  All engineers should be familiar with our PR guidelines: they describe how we apply our engineering values when making PRs.

- [ ] **Engineer**: submit your first PR.

- [ ] **Engineer**: request a review for your first PR.

  You can use GitHub to [request a review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) from an individual or team. We always try to prioritize prompt reviews and [automated reminders](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-organization) of pending review requests are posted in Slack.

- [ ] **Engineer**: get your first PR approved by its reviewer.

  This may mean responding to any changes suggested by your reviewer and asking them to re-review the PR. A PR may go through the review/respond/re-review cycle several times before it gets approved. Our [guidelines for how to make a good PR][1] include tips for responding to suggestions.

- [ ] **Engineer**: merge your PR once it's been approved.

- [ ] **Engineer**: deploy or release your merged PR.

  If your PR was to a web app you need to test on QA and deploy to production.
  If your PR is to another project you may need to release a new version of that project.
  See our [docs about merging PRs](https://github.com/hypothesis/onboarding/blob/main/docs/merging.md) for details.
